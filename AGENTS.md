# AGENTS Instructions

leaf is an AI agent framework in Rust with pure CLI interfaces.
leaf is forked from block/goose project with UI/v8 related components removed and all 'goose' literal has been replaced with 'leaf'.

## Setup
```bash
source bin/activate-hermit
cargo build
```

## Commands

### Build
```bash
cargo build                   # debug
cargo build --release         # release  
just release-binary           # release + openapi
```

### Test
```bash
cargo test                   # all tests
cargo test -p leaf          # specific crate
cargo test --package leaf --test mcp_integration_test
just record-mcp-tests        # record MCP
```

### Lint/Format
```bash
cargo fmt
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

### Git
```bash
git commit -s                # required for DCO sign-off
```

```

## Development Loop
```bash
# 1. source bin/activate-hermit
# 2. Make changes
# 3. cargo fmt
```

### Run these only if the user has asked you to build/test your changes:
```
# 1. cargo build
# 2. cargo test -p <crate>
# 3. cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
# 4. [if server] just generate-openapi
```

## Rules

Test: Prefer tests/ folder, e.g. crates/goose/tests/
Test: When adding features, update goose-self-test.yaml, rebuild, then run `goose run --recipe goose-self-test.yaml` to validate
Error: Use anyhow::Result
Provider: Implement Provider trait see providers/base.rs
MCP: Extensions in crates/goose-mcp/
Server: Changes need just generate-openapi

## Code Quality

Comments: Write self-documenting code - prefer clear names over comments
Comments: Never add comments that restate what code does
Comments: Only comment for complex algorithms, non-obvious business logic, or "why" not "what"
Simplicity: Don't make things optional that don't need to be - the compiler will enforce
Simplicity: Booleans should default to false, not be optional
Errors: Don't add error context that doesn't add useful information (e.g., `.context("Failed to X")` when error already says it failed)
Simplicity: Avoid overly defensive code - trust Rust's type system
Logging: Clean up existing logs, don't add more unless for errors or security events

## Never

Never: Edit Cargo.toml use cargo add
Never: Skip cargo fmt
Never: Merge without running clippy
Never: Comment self-evident operations (`// Initialize`, `// Return result`), getters/setters, constructors, or standard Rust idioms

## Entry Points
- CLI: crates/goose-cli/src/main.rs
- Server: crates/goose-server/src/main.rs
- Agent: crates/goose/src/agents/agent.rs
